Within these exciting blocks, travelers will find an assortment of exciting things to do from January 1 to New Yearâ€™s Eve among the neon signs and NYC landmarks. Times Square attractions run the gamut from the arts and opera to retail shops and TV studios.\r\n\r\nWithin a few blocks, travelers will find that several different shows film and welcome average folks to be a part of the audience. Some of the more popular shows, such as Saturday Night Live, David Letterman, Good Morning America, and The Daily Show require tickets. No tickets are necessary to hang out on Rockefeller Center to see The Today Show. The free outdoor concerts hosted by the morning and late-night shows are some of the coolest things to do in Times Square every summer. Visitors can join in the local arts by catching these concerts and more.\r\n\r\nTimes Square attractions like Rockefeller Center, the NBC studio tour, skating on Rockefeller Center, Museum of the City of New York, the Museum of Modern Art, Museum of American Folk Art, and The Museum of Television & Radio offer interesting experiences, all with a Manhattan flair.\r\n\r\nMany repeat NYC visitors list shopping and dining among their favorite things to do in Times Square. With a mix of familiar names, unique outposts, and flagship stores, Times Square shopping is expansive, luxurious, and a treat to many. FAO Schwarz, made famous in the movie Big, still features that iconic floor piano. Other retail Times Squares attractions include the CBS Store, Dale and Thomas Popcorn, and Sephora. And between the food vendors, favorite names, and New York landmarks, no diner will leave Times Square hungry.\r\n\r\nThose looking for something special when considering what to do in Times Square should consider the popular Manhattan landmark of Grand Central Terminal, which is much more than a train station. A few blocks from the theater district, Grand Central is home to restaurants, a market, and shops, in addition to being an architectural landmark. Guided tours and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Gallery Annex reveal the history and current culture of this amazing place.\"",

We had a 11-month old baby with us, and while it's true, you can hear outside noise, our baby was able to sleep through it all. Best of all is the location! Super convenient! Times Square is a few blocks away, the subway is across the street, cafes, pizza, Duane Reade, and shops all around! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay somewhere close to Times Square!",
